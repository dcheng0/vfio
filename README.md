# vfio
> a documentation of a beginner's experiementation with implementing VFIO from other projects

This project is mostly the following sources, put into script forms. This is to make it easier as I experiment with it across different distros and with different settings. All credit to the following projects. I take no credit for any of the work done, I am simply documenting my experiences implementing it. I highly encourage anyone interested in VFIO to check them out.
